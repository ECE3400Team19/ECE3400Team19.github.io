## Team Tasks


## Lab Description

In this lab, we added sensors and circuitry to our robot. The first was a microphone circuit that detects a 660Hz signal, this signal will be used to signify the start of the final competition. The second was an IR circuit that detects a 6.08kHz signal, a frequency that will be emitted by other robots during the competition. For both circuits, we need to be able to distinguish the desired frequency from decoys.
