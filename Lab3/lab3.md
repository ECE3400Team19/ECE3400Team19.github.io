## Team Tasks
* Radio Team: Cynthia, Robert, Laasya
* Integration Team: Asena, Nonso

## Lab Description
In this lab, we integrated the work from previous labs and milestones. We integrated the microphone circuit into the robot so that the robot could start on a 660 Hz tone. We then had out robot navigate a maze on its own, and send the maze information wirelessly to a base station. The base station displayed the updates on a screen.
