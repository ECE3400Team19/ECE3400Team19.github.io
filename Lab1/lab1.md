## Description

In this lab, we used the various functionalities of the Arduino Uno and the Arduino IDE, as well as the GitHub repository. 
We brainstormed and constructed a simple functional Arduino program using multiple external components and the Arduino Uno. 
We then put together our robot and had it perform a [simple autonomous task](#robot-demo). 

## Materials

* 1 Arduino Uno (in the box)
* 1 USB A/B cable (in the box)
* 1 Continuous rotation servos
* 1 Pushbutton
* 1 LED (any color except IR!)
* 1 Potentiometer
* Several resistors (kÎ© range)
* 1 Solderless breadboard

## Part 1 - Modifying the Blink sketch

## Part 2 - Using the analog output

## Part 3 - Using the Parallax servos

## Part 4 - Assembling the robot!
